cromlech.zodb provide base utilities to have sites persisted in zodb served
with cromlech.

declare application with entry points
=======================================

``cromlech.zodb`` contains a utility to help initialize application based on
entry_points provided by packages.


LocalSiteManager
==================

The package provide a PossibleSite class to be used as a mixin for your
applications root objects::

    >>> from cromlech.zodb.components import PossibleSite
    >>> from zope.component.interfaces import IPossibleSite
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    
    >>> site = PossibleSite()
    >>> verifyObject(IPossibleSite, site)
    True

This is a possible site, not yet a site::

    >>> from zope.component.interfaces import ISite
    >>> ISite.providedBy(site)
    False

We can set up a local site manager::

    >>> from cromlech.zodb.components import LocalSiteManager
    >>> from cromlech.zodb.interfaces import ILocalSiteManager
    
    >>> lsm = LocalSiteManager(site)
    >>> verifyObject(ILocalSiteManager, lsm)
    True
    
A Possible site with a local site manager becomes an ISite::

    >>> from zope.component.interfaces import ISite
    >>> ISite.providedBy(site)
    True
